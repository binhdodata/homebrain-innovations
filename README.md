HomeBrain Property Price Predictor 🏡

Overview
HomeBrain is a property price predictor application built with Flask, which leverages the RandomForest Regressor to estimate property prices and assist users in discovering properties listed below their market value. This project was undertaken as part of the Berkeley Extension Data BootCamp, with a dedicated team working over two weeks to bring this idea to life.
